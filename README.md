Dynamic-Metadata-Generator-
===========================

Extremely easy way, to explain what these files do is, to image: 

That you have a basic site, with static & one dynamic page. That means, you may have static pages like (home, about, portofolio, contact) pages. All are basic, and accessible through one page i.e. index.php?page=home, ?=about... BUT, you also have one dynamic page, let's call it articles.php?id=99. 

OK! Now, if you include this class, then give it a title, keywords, content for each of your static pages + provide table, row name for that daynamic page we talked, about. Then, you don't have to every worry about, what to put inside the </head></head> tags i.e. SEO-wise, speaking. 


Just, include the header file in your main page, and call in the class.
