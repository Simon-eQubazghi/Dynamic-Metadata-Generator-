Dynamic-Metadata-Generator-
===========================
Every created a simple blog site, with few static pages and wanted to set up the title, content, and keywords but felt lazy somehow? Well, here is your rescue. 


Extremely easy way, to explain what these files do is, to imagine: 

That you have a basic site, with static & one dynamic page. That means, you may have static pages like (home.php, about.php, portofolio.php, contact.php) pages. All are basic, and/or could be accessible through one page i.e. index.php?page=home, index.php?=about... BUT, you also have one dynamic page, let's call it articles.php?id=99. 

OK! Now, if you include this class, then give it ONCE, a title, keywords, content for each of your static pages + provide table, row name for that daynamic page we talked, about. Then, you don't have to every worry about, what to put inside the </head></head> tags i.e. SEO-wise, speaking. 


Just, include the header file in your main page, and call in the class.
